# Aria-UV-Filtration-Device

At the HK Maker Lab Program, I learned the foundation and interworkings of engineering design. We focused on addressing a health problem as we worked in teams to prototype and test a biomedical device, and develop an associated business plan. The program culminates in a pitch event to leading executives from the biomedical community. My team and I created a UV filtration device, Aria, for third world countries.
